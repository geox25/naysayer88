# Change Log

## v1.1.5

- VSCode decided to change the quick input highlighting behavior once again from vscode v1.54.2's change. It has now been moved to `quickInputList.focusBackground` for 1.54.3.
Left all the other implementations for legacy purposes

## v1.1.4

- Add focus color for `quickInput.list.focusBackground` due to vscode breaking it with latest update

## v1.1.3

- Set `#0000FF` (default selection color) to `editor.rangeHighlightBackground` to enable line highlighting for when symbol matches are searched for.

To customize this if you do not like the change, you can add the following to your settings file:

```
"workbench.colorCustomizations": {
    "editor.rangeHighlightBackground": "#<color>"
}
```
